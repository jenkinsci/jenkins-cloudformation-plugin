<div>
Creates <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">AWS CloudFormation</a> stacks before the build and deletes them after the build.<br/>
The outputs of the cloudformation are exported as environment variables.
Environment variable names will be prefixed with the stack name parameter.
Amazon enforces the stack name to be unique in the same account so this way we guarantee there will be no collisions between several runs of the same stack.
You can reference them from other steps in the build by using: $[stack name]_[output name].
